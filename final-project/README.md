#Final Project - NYC Community Garden Plaques#
A system to generate a unique plaque for community gardens around NYC.
Each garden has it's own character: what they grow of course, but how they
embrace the aspect of community. These plaques attempt to offer a quick visual
glimpse into the character of a garden based on what they do - do they produce
food, hold community or artistic events, provide educational or family events,
etc.
